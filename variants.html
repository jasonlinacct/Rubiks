        <h1>Cube Variants</h1>
        <p>Explore different variations and types of Rubik's Cubes, such as the 4x4x4, 5x5x5, Megaminx, and more.
            Rubik's Cube variants are a great way to challenge yourself and improve your problem-solving skills. 
            They can also be a lot of fun to collect and play with. There are many different variations available, 
            including different sizes, shapes, and mechanisms. Some popular Rubik's Cube variants include the 2x2 
            Pocket Cube, the 4x4 Rubik's Revenge, and the 5x5 Professor's Cube. There are also pyramid-shaped cubes, 
            megaminxes, and dodecahedrons. Some variants have different mechanisms than the classic cube, such as the 
            Mirror Cube with mirrors on its sides and the Skewb with a triangular shape.</p>
