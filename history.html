        <h1>History of the Cube</h1>
        <p>Learn about the fascinating history of the Rubik's Cube, its invention, and its journey to becoming a global phenomenon.
            The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture. Rubik originally created the cube as a teaching tool to help his students understand three-dimensional geometry. He called it the "Magic Cube."
            The Rubik's Cube was first released in Hungary in 1977, and it quickly became a popular puzzle toy. The cube was introduced to the international market in 1980, and it quickly became a global phenomenon.
            The Rubik's Cube was one of the most popular toys of the 1980s, and it has remained popular ever since. It is estimated that over 350 million Rubik's Cubes have been sold worldwide.
            The Rubik's Cube has been credited with helping to popularize mathematics and science, and it has also been used in educational settings to teach students about problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
            In addition to being a popular toy, the Rubik's Cube is also a competitive speedcubing event. Speedcubers compete to see who can solve a Rubik's Cube the fastest. The current world record for solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube is 3.47 seconds, set by Yusheng Du of China in 2018.
            The Rubik's Cube is a classic puzzle toy that has been enjoyed by people of all ages.
